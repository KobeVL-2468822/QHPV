# QPTA
The QUIC & HTTP/3 Prioritization Visualizer (QHPV) is a straightforward tool designed to read and visualize .qlog- and .sqlog files. It provides an overview of the streams, including any changes in priority. 

Plots to visualize QUIC and HTTP/3 Prioritization:

- Cumulative Data Received per Stream Over Time
- Priority/Urgency History Of Streams
- Multiplexer-Active Streams
- Aggregated Received Data per Time Unit

This repository represents just a portion of my "Tooling support for analyzing priorities in HTTP/3" research project.
